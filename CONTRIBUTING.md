> **Warning**: This codebase was primarily generated by Artificial Intelligence ("AI-Slop") and reviewed by a human. It works, but it may not follow standard conventions, best practices, or optimized patterns.

## 🧠 Philosophy
We accept the chaos. We are not looking for "Clean Code" perfection. We are looking for functionality that serves the philosophical goal: **breaking the addictive loop.**

## 🛠️ How to Contribute

1.  **Fixing Breakages**  
    Instagram updates their CSS classes frequently. If the blocker stops working, find the new selectors (prefer `aria-label` or stable attributes over obfuscated classes like `_a9ze`) and submit a PR.

2.  **No Judgement**  
   Do not open issues purely to critique the AI-generated nature of the code unless you are providing a refactor that maintains intended functionality. *(Traditional programmers may judge you however.)*

3.  **Features**  
    If you want to add a feature, ensure it aligns with the goal of *reducing* addiction or *increasing* user agency. Features that increase engagement (like "auto-likers") will be rejected.

## Code of Conduct
Be excellent to each other. We are all just trying to escape the algorithmic Skinner box.
