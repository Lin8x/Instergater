# Contributing to Insta-Gater

**Warning**: This codebase was primarily generated by Artificial Intelligence ("AI-Slop") and reviewed by a human. It works, but it may not follow standard conventions, best practices, or optimized patterns. 

## Philosophy
We accept the chaos. We are not looking for "Clean Code" perfection. We are looking for functionality that serves the philosophical goal: **breaking the addictive loop.**

## How to Contribute

1.  **Fixing Breakages**: Instagram updates their CSS classes frequently. If the blocker stops working, find the new selectors (prefer `aria-label` or stable attributes over obfuscated classes like `_a9ze`) and submit a PR.
2.  **No Judgement**: Do not open issues purely to critique the AI-generated nature of the code unless you are providing a refactor that maintains intended functionality.
3.  **Features**: If you want to add a feature, ensure it aligns with the goal of *reducing* addiction or *increasing* user agency. Features that increase engagement (like "auto-likers") will be rejected.

## Development Setup
1.  Fork the repo.
2.  Load the extension unpacked in Chrome (`chrome://extensions` > Developer Mode > Load Unpacked).
3.  Make your changes.
4.  Test manually (there are no unit tests).
5.  Submit a Pull Request.

## Code of Conduct
Be excellent to each other. We are all just trying to escape the Skinner box.
