## The Philosophy of the Gate

I built Instergater because modern social media is not merely a tool but rather an environment designed to strip you of your autonomy. The algorithmic feeds we consume are inherently immoral because they systematically violate the conditions necessary for a flourishing human life:

1.  **Alienation**: The algorithm disconnects us from our true selves, replacing our authentic desires with manufactured cravings for engagement.
2.  **Internal Motivational Coherence**: It fragments our attention, making it impossible to align our short-term actions (scrolling) with our long-term values (creating, living).
3.  **Non-Adaptive Preferences**: We learn to prefer the infinite scroll not because it is good, but because we have adapted to the constraints of the cage.
4.  **Baseline Competence**: By outsourcing our validation to external metrics (likes), we atrophy our ability to judge our own worth.
5.  **External Constraints**: The design patterns (infinite scroll, auto-play) are not neutral choices; they are shackles.

This extension is a nihilistic attempt to use code to break the code. It is a "gate" that forces friction into a frictionless system, returning a small sliver of agency to the user.

## Features

*   **Breathing Room**: Enforces a deep breath (delay) before entering the feed.
*   **Scroll Limits**: Hard locks the feed after a set number of posts.
*   **Validation Removal**: Hides likes, shares, and comments to re-center your internal locus of evaluation.
*   **Data Sovereignty**: Download media to own it, rather than just consuming it.

</br>

## Open Source & Transparency
This project is fully open source. The code is unminified and available for you to inspect.
- **Privacy**: No external analytics. No data harvesting.
- **Safety**: Designed to be non-malicious. You are encouraged to read the source code (`content.js`, `background.js`) yourself to verify. *(This should be standard practice before installing anything!)*
